Welcome to aichat 0.23.0 Type \u0026#34;.help\u0026#34; for additional help. @job\u0026gt; Now, all of my blog posts in English at Kiils are stored as embeddings in this small knowledge database I just made.\nIn this means I can now do semantic search and find relevant information. I can simply search for content relevant to, in our example here, a specific job offer - and I can do write the search query in natural language:\n@job\u0026gt; I am applying for a job as an AI engineer with a focus on generative artificial intelligene, please give me relevant examples from the blog postings - you may elaborate on how exactly these are relevant for an AI engineer position at a company Then the RAG comes up with this answer:\n—————— Here are some relevant examples from the blog postings that could be useful for an AI engineer position, particularly focused on generative artificial intelligence:\nMarvin Library for AI Integration:\nThe blog discusses Marvin, a library for integrating AI into software, which can be likened to building various bots with unique AI personalities. For an AI engineer, understanding how to implement such libraries to integrate AI systems into codebases is critical, as it often involves creating efficient and effective solutions for utilizing large language models (LLMs). Embodying Humor in AI:\nAnother example is the challenge of making AI produce humor, tested through different emoji combinations and themes. This reflects the endeavor of creating generative AI models that can mimic human-like creativity and understand context, which is a valuable skill for fine-tuning and training models to fit specific human interactions or entertainment applications. Content Generation Workflows:\nThe blog mentions workflows in AI-assisted content creation, such as semi-automatic (LLM -\u0026gt; editor -\u0026gt; publication) and fully automatic (LLM -\u0026gt; publication) processes. An AI engineer should understand these workflows, their advantages and disadvantages, and how they are constructed and modified to enhance content quality and efficiency while leveraging LLM technology. BER Approach for AI Content:\nThe recipe of starting from a RAG-enhanced base, enriching with knowledge from LLMs, and then manually editing is significant. It shows the iterative process of enhancing AI-generated content, which is crucial for AI engineers who aim to optimize and personalize AI outputs. These examples highlight practical applications and challenges in using generative AI, which are highly relevant to the responsibilities of an AI engineer working in the field. Being able to understand, implement, and improve such systems is key to contributing effectively to a company that develops or utilizes generative AI technologies. ——————\nNot bad.\nI remember writing about workflows.\nI remember coming up with the BASE-ENRICH-REDUCE method, that I even implemented for a large Danish company in the car leasing industry.\nI remember working with the MarvinAI Python library from prefect, good stuff.\nBut what is \u0026ldquo;Embodying Humor in AI\u0026rdquo; about?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s find out:\n@job\u0026gt; In what blog posting did I employ humor with AI? —————— You employed humor with AI in the blog post titled \u0026ldquo;🦶 + 🥔 = Potato foot 🤣 - and other examples of how ChatGPT made my son laugh. And why it is important,\u0026rdquo; published on 22 May 2023. ——————\nAh yes, I remember now. We had such a good laugh. LLM\u0026rsquo;s can write extremely silly stuff humans would have a hard time coming up with :)\nAnyway, as you can see, RAG can be used on your very own information. It can be very useful for doing what embeddings basically do, mapping semantic relations and giving meaningful answers.\nIn this case, to \u0026ldquo;resurface\u0026rdquo; what I have written of relevance to a particular job offering. And with the more general power of LLMs, to present this in a hopefully clear and convincing way in an application for the job.\nAnd, as you can probably imagine, there are endless other ways to make use of this technology.\n","date":"14 November 2024","permalink":"/en/blog/2024-11-14-using-rag-when-writing-job-applications/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Using RAG when writing job applications"},{"content":"Working with AI, particularly LLM\u0026rsquo;s and speech.\nInterested in the interplay of langauge, thought and dialogue.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/en/","section":"Welcome to Kiils","summary":"","title":"Welcome to Kiils"},{"content":"Word frequency analysis is important in quantitative text analysis.\nNushell has a plugin for Polars support.\nWhen installed, you can analyse a large corpus of text very fast:\ndef bible [] { let corp = open --raw /home/lk/Data/king-james-bible.txt | str downcase | split words | polars into-df let stop = [i a an and are as at be by for from how in is it of on or that the this to was what when where who will with the] | polars into-df let mask = $corp | polars is-in $stop let tidy = $corp | polars filter-with ($mask | polars not) let freq = $tidy | polars value-counts let sort = $freq | polars sort-by count $sort } Giving:\n╭───────┬────────────┬───────╮ │ # │ 0 │ count │ ├───────┼────────────┼───────┤ │ 0 │ endow │ 1 │ │ 1 │ clappeth │ 1 │ │ 2 │ elishaphat │ 1 │ │ 3 │ muse │ 1 │ │ 4 │ makaz │ 1 │ │ 5 │ swimmeth │ 1 │ │ 6 │ fidelity │ 1 │ │ 7 │ jeziah │ 1 │ │ 8 │ savours │ 1 │ │ 9 │ ashvath │ 1 │ │ ... │ ... │ ... │ │ 13019 │ all │ 5637 │ │ 13020 │ them │ 6430 │ │ 13021 │ not │ 6624 │ │ 13022 │ him │ 6659 │ │ 13023 │ they │ 7378 │ │ 13024 │ lord │ 7964 │ │ 13025 │ his │ 8473 │ │ 13026 │ unto │ 8997 │ │ 13027 │ shall │ 9840 │ │ 13028 │ he │ 10422 │ ╰───────┴────────────┴───────╯ And it took less than a second.\nTo be specific: 444ms 413µs 290ns.\nDoing the same in \u0026ldquo;vanilla\u0026rdquo; Nushell like so:\ndef biblenu [] { let corp = open --raw /home/lk/Data/king-james-bible.txt | str downcase | split words | wrap corp let stop = [i a an and are as at be by for from how in is it of on or that the this to was what when where who will with the] | wrap stop let tidy = $corp | where corp in $stop.stop == false let freq = $tidy | uniq --count let sort = $freq | sort-by count $sort | flatten } gives\n│ 13019 │ all │ 5637 │ │ 13020 │ them │ 6430 │ │ 13021 │ not │ 6624 │ │ 13022 │ him │ 6659 │ │ 13023 │ they │ 7378 │ │ 13024 │ lord │ 7964 │ │ 13025 │ his │ 8473 │ │ 13026 │ unto │ 8997 │ │ 13027 │ shall │ 9840 │ │ 13028 │ he │ 10422 │ ├───────┼───────┼───────┤ │ # │ corp │ count │ ╰───────┴───────┴───────╯ So the same result.\nBut this time it took: 4sec 118ms 703µs 223ns\nSo Nushell with Polars is around 10x faster for this kind of task than Nushell without Polars.\n","date":"3 October 2024","permalink":"/en/blog/2024-10-03-analysing-the-holy-bible-with-nushell-in-under-a-second/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Analysing the entire Holy Bible in less than a second"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/en/tools/nushell/","section":"Tools","summary":"","title":"Nushell"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/en/tools/polars/","section":"Tools","summary":"","title":"Polars"},{"content":"Markdown is widely used when working with text based generative artificial intelligence.\nYAML is suitable for more structured data.\nThe two can be combined as follows.\n--- title: Blog about Nushell and structured data date: 2024-09-19 tags: - Nushell - data --- The body text goes here.

The scent of old pages filled the air as she flipped through a worn paperback, completely absorbed. Outside, the world buzzed, but within her pages, she traveled to distant lands and met captivating characters. One day, lost in a particularly gripping story, she stumbled upon a mystical map tucked between the chapters. It pulsed with an otherworldly glow. Curiosity igniting, she followed its path, embarking on an adventure beyond her wildest dreams. As she stepped into the world of the book, she realized that in every story, magic awaits those brave enough to read between the lines. Bob 25 gaming In a bustling city, Bob, a 25-year-old gaming enthusiast, discovered a virtual realm where skills blurred reality. One fateful night, while battling a fearsome dragon, he unlocked a glitch—a portal that transported him into the digital landscape. Surrounded by pixelated wonders, Bob no longer had to worry about his mundane job. He wielded a sword forged from the essence of code, joined by allies he\u0026#x27;d only dreamt of. With each victory, he felt alive, more than ever before, but a nagging question lingered: could he return to his world, or was this new home where he truly belonged? As the sun set over the glowing horizon, Bob looked back at the portal, the flickering light a reminder of the life he almost left behind. With a deep breath, he stepped forward into the adventure ahead. Charlie 35 photography Charlie adjusted the lens on his camera, the early morning light dancing through the trees. He captured the world in frames, each click telling a story only he could see. One day, while wandering through a forgotten garden, he stumbled upon a faded photograph half-buried in the dirt. It showed a smiling girl with wildflowers in her hair, her eyes sparkling with joy. Intrigued, Charlie wanted to know her story. As he printed the photo, he noticed a date scribbled on the back—exactly fifty years ago. With each passing moment, he felt a connection, as if the girl was guiding him. Driven by curiosity, he set out to find her, believing that somewhere in the world, magic still lingered among the forgotten memories, waiting for someone to uncover them. Diana 28 painting Diana stood before her easel, the fading light of the day streaming through the window. Each brushstroke whispered secrets of a world only she could see. As she painted, colors melded and flowed, reflecting not just landscapes, but her dreams, hopes, and fears. Today, she tackled a piece she’d long envisioned—a towering oak nestled amidst a field of wildflowers. With each hue, memories flooded back: laughter shared under the sprawling branches, quiet afternoons spent in thoughtful solitude. As the final details emerged, an inexplicable sense of peace washed over her. In that moment, Diana realized that through painting, she wasn\u0026#x27;t just creating art; she was capturing the essence of her own life, boldly framed in vibrant colors and the rich aroma of oil paint. Ethan 22 writing Ethan sat in the dim light of his cramped studio apartment, fingers poised over the keyboard. The scent of stale coffee lingered in the air as he wrestled with his latest story—a tale where words danced like shadows in the moonlight. At 22, his dreams were woven with ink, stretching beyond the walls that confined him. Characters whispered their secrets, pulling him deeper into worlds yet unexplored. He wrote not for fame, but for the heartbeat of creation, and tonight, the pulse of a new adventure throbbed in his veins. As the clock ticked ominously toward midnight, the first sentence spilled forth, igniting the night with infinite possibilities. Ethan smiled, lost in his thoughts, because in the realm of fiction, he could always be more than just a struggling writer. Tonight, he would conquer galaxies.

Quality Control - Human editors can ensure higher accuracy and quality by intervening when necessary. Consistency - Outputs are uniform without any subjective variation. Flexibility - Adaptations can be made on-the-fly based on editor insights or external feedback. Scalability - Easy to scale operations to handle large volumes of tasks without additional human resource costs. Error Correction - Human insight allows for immediate error identification and correction, which might be overlooked by automated systems. Cost Efficiency - Reduces labor costs associated with manual tasks over long periods. Critical Thinking - Humans can apply nuanced judgment that is difficult for automated systems to replicate, especially in complex scenarios. 24/7 Availability - Can operate continuously without breaks or downtime needed by humans. Process Improvement- Human intervention secures immediate feedback on workflow results, improving processes over time. And then, what are the disadvantages?\nDisadvantages # Fully Automatic Workflow Semi-Automatic Workflow Lack of Flexibility - Struggles with handling exceptions or unexpected situations that are not pre-programmed. Slower Processes - Involvement of human editors can slow down the workflow compared to fully automated systems. Limited Understanding - May not interpret complex or nuanced information as effectively as a human. Higher Costs - Requires ongoing investment in human resources, which can be more expensive than fully automated solutions. Dependency on Data Quality - Performance heavily reliant on the quality and breadth of the input data. Inconsistency - Human intervention might introduce variability in the output quality depending on the individual editor\u0026rsquo;s skills and judgments. No Personal Touch - Unable to provide the human-like interactions or decisions that might be necessary in some fields like customer service. Scalability Issues - Scaling up involves additional training and hiring, which can be costly and time-consuming. Over-reliance on Technology - Can lead to reduced skills among staff and an over-dependence on automated systems. Fatigue and Errors - Human editors can make mistakes, especially when handling repetitive tasks or working under pressure. As always you cannot have it all. There are trade offs to both techniques.\nIn reality it is good to switch back and forth between to the two workflow types especially during the development phase to reap the awards and insights of both.\nIt goes without saying that some content creation tasks are more suited for full automatization while others require human oversight.\n","date":"20 July 2024","permalink":"/en/blog/2024-07-20-the-2-basic-workflows-for-ai-assisted-content-generation/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"The 2 basic workflows for ai-assisted content generation"},{"content":"So I want to publish a listicle on my website.\nIt just so happens that listicles are among the content genres that are most effectively and convincingly assisted in their creation by generative artificial intelligence.

These custom commands do different things.\nI then use the custom commands in sequence inside small scripts to make complete workflows from the separate things each custom command does.\nSometimes just looking at a particular script, it can be difficult for me to remember what each command in the script does, and what it does in the context of the script.\nTo ensure that I can easily recall this information a while after I write the script, or to ensure that others can understand the script, I try to annotate each line in the script with a comment.\nHere is an example:\nopen somefile.yaml | each {|row| $row.ai-content | opret fn --print-path $row.ai-title } # opret markdown filer cd /home/lk/Noter/folkets.dk/Notitser/ # skift til bibliotek ls -f | get name | each { udgiv fn $in } # udgiv markdown filerne cd - # tilbage til Scripts Each line consists of the command in the script and then, after the \u0026lsquo;#\u0026rsquo;-sign, my explanation of what the line does.\nIf the above lines are in a file called temp.nu. I can simply write the following in my terminal:\nforklar temp.nu forklar is Danish for \u0026rsquo;explain\u0026rsquo;.\nRunning the above command will give me the following clear presentation of what is going on line by line in the script:\n╭───┬─────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ │ # │ comment │ code │ ├───┼─────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ 0 │ opret markdown filer │ open somefile.yaml | each {|row| $row.ai-content | opret fn --print-path $row.ai-title } │ │ 1 │ skift til bibliotek │ cd /home/lk/Noter/folkets.dk/Notitser/ │ │ 2 │ udgiv markdown filerne │ ls -f | get name | each { udgiv fn $in } │ │ 3 │ tilbage til Scripts │ cd - │ ╰───┴─────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ The reason I can do this is because I have created a custom command in Nushell called forklar like so:\ndef forklar [path: string] { cat $path | from csv -s '#' -c '#' -n | rename code comment | move comment --before code } As the numbers of scripts I develop increase, this helps me remember exactly what the scripts do and how they do it.\nNushell already has an even better way of doing this for custom commands built right in to its help system.\n","date":"24 June 2024","permalink":"/en/blog/2024-06-24-using-nushell-to-make-sense-of-my-nushell-scripts/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Using this simple Nushell command to make sense of my many Nushell scripts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/en/tools/nvim/","section":"Tools","summary":"","title":"Nvim"},{"content":"I took me a little while completely getting Nushell to work as the shell in neovim, but having Nushell at my fingertips directly in my text editor was well worth the effort.\nI am using astronvim and altered the astrocore.lua file like so:\nshell = \u0026quot;/home/lk/.cargo/bin/nu\u0026quot;, shellcmdflag = \u0026quot;--login --stdin --no-newline -c\u0026quot;, shellredir = \u0026quot;out+err\u0026gt; %s\u0026quot;, shellpipe = \u0026quot;| complete | update stderr { ansi strip } | tee { get stderr | save --force --raw %s } | into record\u0026quot;, shelltemp = false, shellxescape = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, shellxquote = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, shellquote = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, Some more generel explanation and settings can be found here:\nintegrations/nvim/init.lua at main · Nushell/integrations\nPS.

and the many other more or less official holidays that spring offers in Denmark. And there are a lot of them.\nMy point was that for a self-employed person who works from home, these could well be perceived as interruptions. As a kind of disturbance.\nThere were many reactions, as you now call it, to my post.\nSome stated that the many small mini-holidays in the spring were a welcome break from life as a wage earner in the hamster wheel.\nAnd yes. It was precisely a different perspective than the one I myself had p resented. And a perspective that I can easily relate to even though I am not independ ent. I can put myself in other situations if I pay attention to it.\nThere were also a number of other reactions which were of a slightly different type.\nIt was reactions that reminded me of the way the big language models work.\nBecause it was reactions that took fragments of what I put up, and work further with these fragments. And almost started to deduce other things than what I had actually written.\nWhen the language models do that, we say they \u0026ldquo;hallucinate\u0026rdquo;.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound nice to say about people that they hallucinate when they maybe put a little too much into something you write or interpret a little too much from it.\nBut these are clearly examples of what happens when you do not treat other people\u0026rsquo;s words in a disciplined manner.\nThen it often becomes somewhat free association.\nYou can reduce the \u0026ldquo;risk\u0026rdquo; of a conversation being characterized by too much free association, just as you can give it direction and context.\nThis kind of thing is no guarantee that the conversation won\u0026rsquo;t slip off the track and end up in a completely different place than it started. But you reduce the risk of that.\nBut also remember this:\nThe ordinary everyday conversation depends precisely on the other part y inviting in. And we all tend to fill a conversation with our own interpretations.\nThe problem arises when people conclude or infer something about the original text based on their own interpretation of it - without being sufficiently aware that this is happening.\nIf you, as a human, still want to retain some advantages over artificial intelligence for a while, then I would recommend that you pay attention to how you relate to other people\u0026rsquo;s words.\nBecause otherwise you run the risk of becoming a mediocre language model or a slightly advanced, but rather severely biased \u0026ldquo;auto-complete.\u0026rdquo;\nIt is at least as important, however, that you, as the person who starts a debate or posts some text, think a little about your wording.\nAs when talking with ChatGPT, it is important to set the framework for the conversation clearly from the start.\nSo both the sender of a message and the recipient of it have a responsibility for a successful conversation.\nAnd this applies regardless of whether you are talking to a human or a machine.\n","date":"23 May 2023","permalink":"/en/blog/humans-should-also-be-prompted-properly/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Humans should also be prompted properly"},{"content":"I wanted to use the font Noto Sans with the Noto Emoji font for making an image overlay text in Hugo.\nI used Fontforge to merge the two fonts.\nAt first the emoji font was much larger than the text font.\nIn my case it only worked properly when\nOpening the text font first with \u0026lsquo;File -\u0026gt; Open File\u0026rsquo;.

While the Markov Chain is a mathematical model that can be used to generate text, it is a relatively simple model compared to neural network-based models like ChatGPT.\nChatGPT is trained on a massive amount of text data and uses a deep neural network with multiple layers to learn patterns in the data. The model is trained to predict the next word in a sentence based on the context of the previous words. This allows ChatGPT to generate text that is more coherent and semantically meaningful than text generated by a simple Markov Chain.\nMarkov Chain, on the other hand, is a statistical model that uses a set of states and transition probabilities to predict the next state in a sequence. It is trained on a smaller amount of data compared to neural network-based models like ChatGPT and generates text based on the probability of certain words or phrases following others.\nIn summary, ChatGPT is a much more advanced and sophisticated model than a simple Markov Chain, and can generate text that is more coherent, contextually appropriate, and human-like.\nMe: how does a markov chain differ from \u0026ldquo;deep learning\u0026rdquo; in neural networks\nChatGPT:\nMarkov Chain and deep learning neural network are two different approaches to modeling and generating sequences of data, such as text.\nA Markov Chain is a mathematical model that uses a set of states and transition probabilities to predict the next state in a sequence. It is trained on a relatively small amount of data and generates text by predicting the next word or phrase based on the probability of certain words or phrases following others. Markov Chain models are simple and computationally efficient, but they are limited in their ability to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data.\nDeep learning neural networks, on the other hand, are a type of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to learn patterns in data. These models are trained on a large amount of data and are able to automatically learn representations of the data that can be used to generate text or other sequences. They are more powerful and flexible than Markov Chain models as they can learn a wide range of features and patterns in the data, and can also be used to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis.\nIn summary, Markov Chain is a simpler model compared to deep learning neural network, but deep learning neural networks are more powerful and flexible. They are able to learn more complex patterns in data and can be used to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks.\n","date":"12 January 2023","permalink":"/en/blog/chatgpt-glorified-markov-chain/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Is ChatGPT more than a glorified Markov chain?
