<div class="blog-content text-justify leading-loose mb-12 mx-auto sm:max-w-vw-5/6 text-md">
	<p>The other day I posted a few lines on Facebook.</p>
<p>My intention was to point out what can be called <em>perspective</em> - that a case can be seen from several angles.</p>
<p>Specifically, it was about &ldquo;Store Bededag&rdquo; and the many other more or less official holidays that spring offers in Denmark.
And there are a lot of them.</p>
<p>My point was that for a self-employed person who works from home, these could well be perceived as interruptions. As a kind of disturbance.</p>
<p>There were many reactions, as you now call it, to my post.</p>
<p>Some stated that the many small mini-holidays in the spring were a welcome break from life as a wage earner in the hamster wheel.</p>
<p>And yes. It was precisely a different perspective than the one I myself had p
resented. And a perspective that I can easily relate to even though I am not independ
ent. I can put myself in other situations if I pay attention to it.</p>
<p>There were also a number of other reactions which were of a slightly different type.</p>
<p>It was reactions that reminded me of the way the big language models work.</p>
<p>Because it was reactions that took fragments of what I put up, and work further with these fragments. And almost started to deduce other things than what I had actually written.</p>
<p>When the language models do that, we say they &ldquo;hallucinate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t sound nice to say about people that they hallucinate when they maybe put a little too much into something you write or interpret a little too much from it.</p>
<p>But these are clearly examples of what happens when you do not treat other people&rsquo;s words in a disciplined manner.</p>
<p>Then it often becomes somewhat free association.</p>
<p>You can reduce the &ldquo;risk&rdquo; of a conversation being characterized by too much free association, just as you can give it direction and context.</p>
<p>This kind of thing is no guarantee that the conversation won&rsquo;t slip off the track and end up in a completely different place than it started. But you reduce the risk of that.</p>
<p>But also remember this:</p>
<p>The ordinary everyday conversation depends precisely on the other part
y inviting in. And we all tend to fill a conversation with our own interpretations.</p>
<p>The problem arises when people conclude or infer something about the original text based on their own interpretation of it - without being sufficiently aware that this is happening.</p>
<p>If you, as a human, still want to retain some advantages over artificial intelligence for a while, then I would recommend that you pay attention to how you relate to other people&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>Because otherwise you run the risk of becoming a mediocre language model or a slightly advanced, but rather severely biased &ldquo;auto-complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is at least as important, however, that you, as the person who starts a debate or posts some text, think a little about your wording.</p>
<p>As when talking with ChatGPT, it is important to set the framework for the conversation clearly from the start.</p>
<p>So both the sender of a message and the recipient of it have a responsibility for a successful conversation.</p>
<p>And this applies regardless of whether you are talking to a human or a machine.</p>
